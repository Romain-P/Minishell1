Clone this project with `git clone https://github.com/romain-p/minishell1`  
##### What is it
A simple shell in which you can write commands such as `ls` or other any existed unix binaries.  
Pipes and multi-processes line commands are not handled.  
##### How to use
* First build the project executing `make`
* Launch on a command file with `./mysh file`
* Launch with piped commands with  `echo "command" | ./mysh`
* Launch as normal mode with `./mysh`
* Exit shell `pressing ^D`

**The code** respects *Epitech-Norm* and contains no memory leak and no error.  
**Notice :** custom built-in `cd` `env` `setenv` `unsetenv` have to be written *(look @src/built-in)*
